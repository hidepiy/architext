= Markup: Asciidoc

We're using AsciiDoc as our default markup language.
Technically we can also use Markdown file with ".md" extention (ex. README.md) but let's standardize with Asciidoc for our convenience.

About Asciidoc syntax, you can refer to https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference].
